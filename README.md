# Plagiarism Detection Based on Structural Information (Conducted with Kim, Jaesung)
 In this paper, we propose the novel algorithm for the near-duplicate detection which is the method to detect the plagiarism document. We detected if the document is plagiarised, and the source document if it exists. The difference with the previous research, we only used the stop word, which represents the structure of the document. We proved that only using less than 5% of memory, it does not hurt the performance.
